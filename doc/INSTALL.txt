This distribution contains 2 sets of functionalities:

1. A UMO component generator that creates Mule components with host access
   capabilities based on LegStar. These components do not internally use
   the legstar mule transport.
   
2. The legstar mule transport prototype. This prototype is derived from
   the Mule Http transport so it will only allow host connectivity over
   Http.
   

Using the UMO component generator:
---------------------------------
Unzip the distribution file to a location of your choice.

The ant folder contains a sample build.xml script that you can customize to
generate a Mule component.

By default, build.xml generates a component for the sample LSFILEAE cobol
program, part of the standard LegStar delivery.

In order to create your own Mule-LegStar components you will have to
create legStar binding classes first. These classes are generated using the
standard LegStar binding generator as described here:
