h2. Overview

Legs4Mule is a Mule transport for IBM mainframes, based on the [LegStar open-source mainframe integration|http://www.legsem.com/legstar] project.

Legs4Mule has design time features that generates artifacts for Mule. These artifacts can be deployed as Mule UMOs of 2 types:

* Mainframe Adapters gives access to a remote mainframe program from any ESB client

* Mainframe proxies give mainframe programs access to ESB UMO components

h2. Benefits

* End-to-end open-source mainframe integration solution
* Bi-directional, mainframe acts as server for Mule clients or as client for Mule UMOs
* Binary wire protocol between Mule and the mainframe, reduces overhead
* Flexible COBOL binding framework based on Java binding (JAXB)
